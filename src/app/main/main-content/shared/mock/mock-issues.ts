Motions are registered in advance as a sequence of poses. If a pose sequence is matched with registered motion, the recognizer returns the motion as a retrieved result. In this version, 4 poses are registered(Rest, Ready, Left zap, Right zap), so that this software is able to recognize simple “Zap” motion of boxing.
